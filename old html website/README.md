## Development

The development of First Robotics Competition Team 7790's website is 100% open source and developed entirely by students. The goal of this website is to provide an access point to our team, our robots, and our work for sponsors, other teams, parents, and the general public. We strive to provide a high quality website that is both informative and inspiring.

## Contribution

The development of the website is ran by a very small team of a few students who are passionate about their FRC Team. The development of this website is not their sole responsibility, they have a hand in the CAD, Design, Programming, Build, and the overall running of the team. This engagement in every aspect of the team is integral for the accurate design of a website. However, this workload is ectremely high. We would appreciate any work by the open source community to resolve issues that have been listed, report bugs, typos, and flaws, and contribute to bettering the experience of the webste. For more see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [CODE OF CONDUCT](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Goals for the Website

We are striving to build an interactive, modern, engaging, and well built website with robust features and compatability across a multitude of devices. We want to build a website that elegantly showcases the work we do and provides information well, while keeping with a very modern and proffesional style. 

## Deployment

The website is deployed through GitHub Pages onto our custom domain [FRC7790.com](https://FRC7790.com). This deployment allows for the development of a static website with rapid prototyping.
