# Recurring Events Implementation Summary

## What's Been Added

âœ… **Database Schema**
- Added 13 new columns to `calendar_events` table for recurring event functionality
- Supports complex recurrence patterns and exceptions
- Maintains parent-child relationships for event instances

âœ… **Recurrence Types Supported**
- **Daily**: Every N days
- **Weekly**: Every N weeks, with specific day selection
- **Monthly**: By specific date or by weekday position (e.g., "2nd Tuesday")
- **Yearly**: Every N years, with month selection

âœ… **End Conditions**
- Never ending
- After specific number of occurrences  
- Until specific end date

âœ… **Advanced Features**
- Exception dates (skip specific occurrences)
- Individual instance editing vs. series editing
- Event duration with start and end times
- Visual indicators for recurring events

âœ… **Backend API**
- Updated calendar endpoints to handle recurring events
- Dynamic generation of recurring instances within date ranges
- Exception management endpoints
- Support for editing individual instances or entire series

âœ… **Frontend Components**
- `RecurrenceForm`: Comprehensive UI for configuring recurrence
- Updated `Calendar` component with recurring event support
- Visual indicators and improved event display
- Modal interface for creating/editing recurring events

âœ… **Utility Functions**
- `recurrence.ts`: Core logic for generating recurring event instances
- Date calculation and validation functions
- Recurrence pattern formatting and description

## Key Features

### 1. Flexible Recurrence Patterns
```typescript
// Weekly meeting every Monday and Wednesday
{
  type: 'weekly',
  interval: 1,
  daysOfWeek: ['monday', 'wednesday'],
  endType: 'after_occurrences',
  occurrences: 50
}

// Monthly meeting on 2nd Tuesday
{
  type: 'monthly',
  interval: 1,
  weekOfMonth: 2,
  dayOfWeek: 'tuesday',
  endType: 'never'
}
```

### 2. Exception Management
- Skip individual occurrences without deleting the series
- Add/remove exceptions via API
- Visual feedback for skipped dates

### 3. Smart Instance Handling
- Recurring events generate instances only when needed
- Efficient database queries with date range filtering
- Unique IDs for both parent events and generated instances

### 4. User-Friendly Interface
- Intuitive recurrence configuration form
- Real-time preview of recurrence pattern
- Clear visual distinction between regular and recurring events
- Time range display (start time - end time)

## Usage

### Creating a Recurring Event
1. Click "Add Event" or click on a calendar day
2. Fill in event details (title, description, location, times)
3. Check "Make this a recurring event"
4. Configure recurrence pattern:
   - Select type (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly)
   - Set interval (every N periods)
   - Choose specific days/dates/months as needed
   - Set end condition (never/after N times/until date)
5. Save the event

### Managing Recurring Events
- **Edit Series**: Changes apply to all future instances
- **Edit Instance**: Changes apply only to selected occurrence
- **Delete Instance**: Adds exception to series
- **Delete Series**: Removes entire recurring event

### Visual Indicators
- ðŸ”„ Recurring icon for parent events
- Blue color scheme for recurring events
- "Instance" badge for generated occurrences
- Time display shows duration when end time is set

## Technical Details

### Database Migration
Run the migration file to add recurring event support:
```bash
wrangler d1 execute frc7790-com-dev --file=migrations/007_add_recurring_events.sql
```

### API Changes
- GET `/api/calendar` now accepts `start` and `end` query parameters
- POST `/api/calendar` accepts `is_recurring` and `recurrence` fields
- PUT `/api/calendar/:id` supports series vs. instance editing
- New endpoints for exception management

### Performance
- Events are generated on-demand within requested date ranges
- Database indexes on recurring event fields
- Safety limits prevent infinite recursion
- Efficient caching of parent event data

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Test endpoint: GET `/api/calendar/test/:id` to verify recurring generation
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- TypeScript type safety throughout
- Development environment configuration

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly recurring events system with extensive customization options while maintaining good performance and data integrity.
